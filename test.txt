STAFF SOFTWARE ENGINEER, ML DECISIONING AND DATA-HEAVY BACKENDS
Python, Postgres, XGBoost, PyTorch | Risk, fraud, compliance-style workflows | Production ML and LLMs

SUMMARY
Staff-level software engineer with 18+ years in software engineering and 8+ years building and operating production ML and GenAI systems. Own architecture and roadmap for data-heavy backend systems that power onboarding-style intake, risk and compliance decisioning, and operations review workflows, including integrations, pipelines, model training, batch and real-time inference, and monitoring. Delivered measurable outcomes on workflows processing 116M+ claims annually, including 30% reduction in reviewer time and 10% improvement in signal quality. Strong judgment around correctness, reliability, and operational risk, with low-latency APIs, resilient pipelines, and audit-ready traceability in regulated environments; experienced building decisioning systems where false positives and false negatives have real compliance and operational cost, managed through offline evaluation and monitored rollouts. Interested in Bitcoin and excited by correctness-first systems at scale.
Elixir: ramping quickly; strong backend fundamentals across languages.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

ACENTRA HEALTH, Okemos, MI
Software Engineer, AI/ML | Dec 2016 - Present

Decisioning Platforms (Risk, Compliance, Operations)

* Owned architecture and technical roadmap for ML decisioning systems that power automation across intake, risk, compliance, and operations workflows, partnering with product management and operations to scope initiatives, mentoring engineers on production ML and reliability, and driving long-term scaling through capacity planning, SLOs, and progressive delivery.
* Program Intelligence: ML scoring plus evidence retrieval and grounded narratives for risk and compliance decisioning, reducing reviewer investigation time by 30% and improving signal quality by 10% across workflows processing 116M+ claims annually.
* ClaimsSure: real-time pre-pay fraud scoring and rules decisioning via low-latency APIs, achieving 99.9% availability with external p95 latency 250 to 400 ms (p99 up to 900 ms) while sustaining 50 to 150 RPS.
* AuditStudio: post-pay audit scoring with unsupervised scoring and explainable features, meeting nightly batch SLA of 4 hours or less with 99% or higher run success and improving prioritization precision by 10 to 20% (precision at K) in offline evaluation.

ML Training and Inference Infrastructure

* XGBoost-style risk models: feature engineering, calibration, explainability, and golden-set evaluation, improving targeting accuracy by 8 to 15% with repeatable retrain and refresh workflows.
* SageMaker and Glue pipelines: dataset builds, feature extraction, training, evaluation, and governed promotions using MLflow experiments and model registry patterns for auditable releases.
* Real-time inference operations: PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras deployments including GPU-backed SageMaker endpoints with autoscaling and batching or micro-batching to optimize latency and throughput.

Data Systems and Integrations (Postgres)

* Intake and normalization: deterministic validation and routing pipelines feeding decisioning workflows, meeting batch SLA of 2 hours or less with 99.5% or higher run success and reject rates at 0.5% or less.
* FHIR ingestion services: RDS PostgreSQL with JSONB and GIN indexing plus PgBouncer pooling and maintenance tuning, meeting daily SLA of 2 hours or less and internal p95 latency of 150 ms or less (p99 up to 400 ms).
* Evidence and audit data access: PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, and OpenSearch patterns with Redis caching for hot lookups to stabilize latency under burst traffic.

UI Ownership (Workflow Experience)

* Owned end-user workflow UI (Spring MVC, JSP, React) and supporting APIs for external modules, delivering investigator and operations experiences backed by reliable services and performance-tuned data access patterns.

Reliability, On-call, and Safe GenAI

* Production LLM workflows: Bedrock, OpenAI, and Anthropic integrated with routing, fallbacks, schema validation, and guardrails to prevent unsafe or low-confidence outputs.
* Engineering bar: wrote high-quality, tested code and participated in design and code reviews; maintained regression coverage for critical scoring paths and pipeline changes.
* On-call and runbooks: maintained dashboards, alerts, and incident runbooks for batch and real-time systems; supported on-call operations and rapid rollback procedures to achieve under 10 minute MTTA and under 90 minute MTTR.

INFOSYS LIMITED, Los Angeles, CA and Pune, India
Senior Associate Consultant | Sep 2013 - Dec 2015

* Built backend services and batch processing for high-volume Medicaid encounter workflows using Java, SQL, and Oracle PL/SQL, improving throughput by about 20 to 40% and reducing data-quality exceptions by about 15 to 30% for compliance reporting.
* Translated CMS and state regulatory requirements into technical designs and data contracts and refactored legacy components to reduce change-related defects by about 20 to 30%.

SYNTEL LIMITED, Pune, India
Programmer Analyst | Aug 2010 - Sep 2013

* Built backend integrations for FedEx eDD workflows using Java with REST and SOAP services and transformation logic, improving integration reliability and reducing errors by about 15 to 25%.
* Automated log analysis and reconciliation with Java and SQL utilities, reducing manual ops effort by about 5 to 10 hours per week and improving time-to-detect issues by about 20 to 35%.

COGNIZANT, Hyderabad, India
